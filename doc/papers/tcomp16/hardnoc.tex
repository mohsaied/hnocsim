	\item present the NoC that we are considering in this paper:
	\item give the area  as percentage of a stratix V logic resources.
	\item Scale the frequency to 28nm process technology.
	\item show the packet format - explain packet and flit.
	\item this should lead in to the next section: now keeping all of that in mind, how do we interface the fabric and the NoC?
	\item want to send only the valid flits, interface the two widths etc --> FabricPort

We use an embedded NoC that with virtual channels and credit-based flow control.
We define these two NoC terms~\cite{dally_book} that may be unfamiliar to the reader:
\begin{itemize}
\item Virtual channels (VCs): Separate FIFO buffers at a NoC router input port; if we use 2 VCs in our NoC, then each router input can store incoming flits in one of two possible FIFO buffers.
\item Credit-based flow control: A backpressure mechanism in which each NoC router keeps track of the number of available buffer spaces (credits) downstream, and only sends a flit downstream if it has available credits.
\end{itemize}

Our embedded packet-switched NoC targets a large 28~nm FPGA device.
The NoC presented in this section is used throughout this paper in our design and evaluation sections.
%Fig.~\ref{noc_vs_bus} displays a high-level view of an NoC embedded on an FPGA.
We base our router design on a state-of-the-art packet-switched router that uses credit-based flow control and virtual channels (VCs)~\cite{becker_router}.
%In Section~\ref{sec_fpganoc}, we show how to leverage this NoC router so that it may be used in typical FPGA designs.

In designing the embedded NoC, we must over-provision its resources, much like other FPGA interconnect resources, so that it can be used in connecting \textit{any} application.
We therefore look at high bandwidth I/O interfaces to determine the required NoC link bandwidth.
The highest-bandwidth interface on FPGAs is usually a DDR3 interface, capable of transporting 64~bits of data at a speed of 1067~MHz at double-data rate (\til17 GB/s).
We design the NoC such that it can transport the entire bandwidth of a DDR3 interface on one of its links; therefore, we can connect to DDR3 using a single router port.
Additionally, we must be able to transport the control data of DDR3 transfers, such as the address, alongside the data.
We therefore choose a width of 150~bits for our NoC links and router ports, and we are able to run the NoC at 1.2~GHz\footnote{We implement the NoC in 65~nm standard cells and scale the frequency obtained by 1.35\xx to match the speed scaling of Xilinx's (also standard cell) DSP blocks from Virtex5 (65~nm) to Virtex7 (28~nm)~\cite{xilinx_datasheets}.}~\cite{noc_designer}.
By multiplying our width and frequency, we find that our NoC is able to transport a bandwidth of 22.5~GB/s on each of its links.

Table~\ref{noc_params} summarizes the NoC parameters and properties.
%We use 2 VCs in our NoC.
%Previous work has shown that a second VC reduces congestion by \til30\%~\cite{fpl}.
We leverage VCs to avoid deadlock, and merge data streams as we discuss in Section~\ref{sec_fpganoc}.
Additionally, we believe that the capabilities offered by VCs -- such as assigning priorities to different messages types -- would be useful in future FPGA designs.
The buffer depth per VC is provisioned such that it is not a cause for throughput degradation by sizing our router buffers to cover the \textit{credit round-trip latency}~\cite{dally_book}.
%To ensure that the NoC doesn't stall due to unavailable buffering, we size NoC buffers for maximum throughput, so that we never stall while waiting for backpressure signals within the NoC.
%This is well-studied in the literature and is done by sizing our router buffers to cover the \textit{credit round-trip latency}~\cite{dally_book} -- for our system, a buffer depth of 10 suffices.
With the given parameters, each embedded router occupies an area equivalent to 35~logic clusters (Stratix-V LABs), including the interface between the router and the FPGA fabric, and including the wire drivers necessary for the hard NoC links~\cite{trets}.
As Table~\ref{noc_params} shows, the whole 16-node NoC occupies 528~LABs, a mere 1.3\% of a large 28~nm Stratix-V FPGA core area (excluding I/Os).

\subsection{Packet Format}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%
\figvs{1}{packet_format}{}{NoC packets consist of a head flit and zero-or-more body flits.}
%

Fig.~\ref{packet_format} shows the format of flits on the NoC; each flit is 150~bits making flit width and NoC link width equivalent (as most on-chip networks do)~\cite{dally_book}.
One flit is the smallest unit that can be sent over the NoC, indicating that the NoC will be used for coarse-grained wide datapath transfers.
This packet format puts no restriction on the number of flits that form a packet; each flit has two bits for ``head" and ``tail" to indicate the flit at the start of a packet, and the flit at the end of a packet.
The VC identifier is required for proper virtual-channel flow control, and finally, the head flit must also contain the destination address so that the NoC knows where to send the packet.
The remaining bits are data, making the control overhead quite small in comparison; for a 4-flit packet, control bits make up 3\% of transported data.
